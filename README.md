## Portfolio Website

### Objective 
Hanna Sigge Communications is a portfolio site designed to professionally present myself and my capabilities to prospective clients, so that they might get a better idea of what value I can bring to their organizations. With the goal of gaining interest from them that leads to contracted assignments, I present myself, my background and experiences, and showcase my skills through example projects. The clients can then choose to contact me to discuss working together. 

### Stakeholders
