##Objective of the Portfolio Website
Hanna Sigge Communications is a portfolio site designed to present myself and my capabilities to prospective clients, so that they might get a better idea of what value I can bring to their organizations. I present myself, my background and experiences, and showcase my skills through example projects. The clients can then choose to contact me to discuss working together. 

##Stakeholders
Two stakeholders: the site owner and the visitor. The site owner is me, presenting my portfolio, and the visitor is a potential client.
